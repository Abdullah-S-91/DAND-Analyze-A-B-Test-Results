# DAND-Bike_Share_Analysis
Project 2 on Udacity - Data Analysis 


## Introduction 

this is my frist project using paython with DAND. 

It is About Bike Share

Posing Questions
Before looking at the bike sharing data, you should start by asking questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Motivate. What kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? If you were a user of the bike-share service, what factors might influence how you would want to use the service?

My Posing Questions 

Q1 : What is the proportion of gender (Male/Female) in these three cities?

Q2 : What is the time that have the highest number of trip in these cities?

Then I will Answer these Questions through this project.
